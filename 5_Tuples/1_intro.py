# ------ Tuples in Python ---------
# A built in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values.
tup = (2,1,5,6,3)
print(type(tup))

tups = ()                   # Empty tuple  || 
tps = (1,)                  # take (,) after single element otherwise its recognise other datatype (int,float,string)
